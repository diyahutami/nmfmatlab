You will be able to regenerate tables in Latex format. However,
results may be slightly different due to the randomness, the CPU
speed, and the load of your computer.

- Methods for solving NMF

mult.m:		multiplicative update for NMF
nmf.m:		alternative non-negative least squares 
		using projected gradients for sub-problems
nlssubprob.m:	called by nmf.m for solving sub-problems
pgrad.m: 	direct use of projected gradients for NMF

RUNNING SYNTHETIC DATA
======================

- Simply type 

>> runsynthetic

RUNNING IMAGE DATA
==================

- Download nmfpack by Hoyer at 

  http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/phoyer/code/nmfpack.zip

  Unzip to create the directory nmfpack

- Download CBCL and ORL images at

  http://cbcl.mit.edu/cbcl/software-datasets/FaceData2.html
  http://www.uk.research.att.com/facedatabase.html	

- For CBCL, uncompress face.train.tar.gz to the directory
cbcl-face-database. For ORL, uncompress files to the directory
orl-faces. The directory structure should be like
   
  nmfpack/
    data/
      cbcl-face-database/	  
        face/
          face00001.pgm
          [...]
          face02429.pgm
        non-face/
          [...]
      orl-faces/
        README
          s1/
          [...]
          s40/

- Copy or link .m files to the directory nmfpack/code

- Change to the directory nmfpack/code and type

>> runimage

RUNNING TEXT DATA
=================

- Download a subset of RCV1 data at

  http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/nmf/rcv1/rcv1-v2-train.svm.zip

- Uncompress rcv1-v2-train.svm.zip. Create a directoy called rcv1 and
put the data there.

- Copy or link .m files to the directory rcv1

- Change to the directory rcv1 and type

>> runtext

FIGURE OF TIME VS. OBJECTIVE VALUES
===================================

- Simply type

>> objfig

- An eps file testconv.eps will be genreated.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
================

To access some internal running information of nmf.m and
nlssubprob.m, we use several global variables. Though not a good
convention, we do not want them to be function outputs either. If you
are using them for your own work, these variables are unnecessary and
please download a cleaned version available at
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/nmf

All NMF methods implemented here can be used under octave too.
However, some driver files cannot. The one we have tested is
runsynthetic.m, but you must comment out some places indicated in the
file.
